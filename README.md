# Resource-Checker Android Application

If you want to know the value of a resource from any app that is installed in your device, you can use **Resource Checker**.
This application is capable of inspecting the value of a resource from the following types:
- Integer
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- String Array
- Integer Array
- Drawable
- Mipmap
- Dimen

Also, it has a feature where you can inform the LOCALE for which you want to inspect, for instance, a String without the need of changing your device's language.

Regardless of the resource you want to inspect, when you perform the 'RUN CHECK' verification on a target application, the following information will be displayed:
- Package Name
- App Label (if a custom 'LOCALE' is informed, 2 App Label will be displayed: one in the current locale and the other with the custom LOCALE)
- Version Name
- Version Code
- Resource Name
- Resource Value

If you have any doubts, concerns, complains or suggestions please __[let me know]__!
